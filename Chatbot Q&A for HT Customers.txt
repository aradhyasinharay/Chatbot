Revised Questions and Answers for HT Customers of the Power Casting Chatbot


Power Factor Guidance  

1. What is Power Factor?  
Power Factor (PF) is an indicator of efficient power utilization in an AC (Alternating Current) electrical power system. It is defined as the ratio of real power (kW) flowing to the load to the apparent power (kVA) in the circuit. A PF close to 1.0 (100%) signifies an efficient system.  

2. What Causes Low Power Factor?  
Low PF is primarily caused by inductive loads, which generate reactive power (kVAR). Common examples include:  
- Transformers  
- Induction Motors  
- High-Intensity Discharge Lighting  

3. Why Improve Low Power Factor?
Benefits of improving PF include:  
      1. Reduced Electricity Bills  
  	 - Lower peak billing demand, leading to savings.  
 - Avoid surcharges and earn rebates (e.g., as per WBERC regulations, PF above 92% qualifies for rebates, while PF below 86% incurs surcharges).  
      2. Enhanced System Efficiency	 
   	- Reduced losses in the electrical system.  
   	- Increased capacity to handle additional load.  
      3. Environmental Benefits 
- Lower greenhouse gas emissions by reducing unnecessary generation and transmission capacity.  

4. How to Improve Power Factor?  
a. Install Capacitors (KVAR Generators)  
   - Place capacitors close to motors/loads.  
   - Synchronize capacitor operation with motors/loads (use Automatic Power Factor Controllers (APFC) for automation).  
b. Minimize Idling or Lightly Loaded Motors  
c. Replace Old Motors with energy-efficient models.  
d. Use the Capacitor Bank Calculator on the website for preliminary guidance on capacitor ratings.  

5. Difference Between Instant and Average PF? 
- Instant PF: Displayed on the energy meter, reflects real-time consumption.  
- Average PF (Monthly Bill): Calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{Average PF} = \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\text{Total Monthly Reactive Power (24 HRS SINE)}}{\text{Chargeable Units}}\right)\right)
  \]  

6. Basic Terms:
- kW (Real Power): Power performing useful work.  
- kVAR (Reactive Power): Power needed for magnetizing flux in inductive equipment.  
- kVA (Apparent Power): Vector sum of kW and kVAR.  

7. Power Triangle and Formula:  
\[
\text{PF} = \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{kVA}} = \cos \theta
\]  
- **Ideal Scenario**:  
  - Angle ? ? 0°, PF ? 1 (Unity).  
  - kVAR ? 0, kW ? kVA.  

8. Principle of Power Factor Compensation:  
Compensation reduces reactive power (Q) to a smaller value (Q?) using corrective instruments (Qc), thereby reducing apparent power (S to S?). Formula:  
\[
Q_c = P \left[\tan \theta - \tan \theta_1\right]
\]

Agreemental Load and Demand Charge

1. What is Agreemental Load?  
Agreemental Load (or Contract Demand) is the load (measured in kW or kVA) agreed upon in a written contract between the consumer and CESC Ltd.  

2. What is Maximum Demand?
- Maximum Demand is the highest load recorded (in kW and kVA) by the tariff meter during a billing cycle.  
- It is indicated on the monthly electricity bill.  

3. What is Billing Demand?
- Billing Demand is the higher of the following two values:  
  1. The maximum demand (kVA) recorded for the month, OR  
  2. 85% of the monthly Agreemental Load (Contract Demand in kVA).  
- Demand Charge is calculated based on the Billing Demand, as per WBERC (West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission) regulations.  

4. What Happens if Maximum Demand Exceeds Agreemental Load? 
- If the recorded demand exceeds the Agreemental Load:  
  - "Demand Charge for Excess Drawal" is levied (as per applicable tariff).  
  - It is also a violation of WBERC regulations.  

5. How are Demand Charges Calculated?  
- Demand Charge is based on the Billing Demand.  
- Excess Demand Charge applies if consumption exceeds the Agreemental Load (calculated at the applicable tariff rate under WBERC rules).  


6. Revision of Agreemental Load (Upward/Downward) 
- Consumers should assess their actual load needs (current and future) before requesting a revision.  
- Contact for Revision:
  - Arnab Guha (Manager, Mains Power)  
  - Address: Poddar Court, 18 Rabindra Sarani, Kolkata 700 001  
  - Phone: 033-2225-3550 (Extn. 202) | Mobile: 9903082575  
  - Email: arnab.guha@rp-sg.in  

7. Rules for Revision:
- Upward Revision: No time restrictions; can be done anytime.  
- Downward Revision:  
  - Allowed only once a year.  
  - Must wait at least one year from the last downward revision or from the date of service connection/transfer.

4. How is the Power Factor penalty calculated for HT customers?

Power Factor (PF) penalties are applied when your average PF falls below the acceptable limit (usually 0.90 or 0.95, depending on utility rules). The typical calculation is:
Penalty = (Difference between standard PF and your PF) × Total kVAh × applicable rate
Some utilities also offer incentives for maintaining PF above a certain level. I can share your current PF trend if you provide your HT Consumer Number.

5. Am I eligible for any rebates or incentives as an HT consumer?
