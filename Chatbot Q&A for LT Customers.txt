ECS (Electronic Clearing Service)

- Bulk collections (electricity/water bills, loan EMIs, mutual fund investments, insurance premiums, etc.).  
ECS enables bulk money transfers between one bank account and multiple accounts (or vice versa).  

2. How is ECS Debit Scheme useful? 
- Enables auto-payment of electricity dues directly from your bank account on due dates.  
- 1% additional e-rebate for using this payment mode.  
- No need to track due dates manually.  
- If payment fails on the due date, it will be processed on the next available clearing day.

9. What happens if ECS payment fails due to insufficient funds or technical issues?  
- Technical failure (e.g., server problem): The bill will be re-sent for ECS collection on the next working day.  
- Non-technical failure (e.g., insufficient funds): You must pay through alternative online payment modes.  

10. What is the refund process if a bill is paid twice (via ECS + another method)?
