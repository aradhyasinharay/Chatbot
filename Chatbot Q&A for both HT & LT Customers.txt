 Additional Load / Load Enhancement –
 
9. How do I apply for an additional load for my existing connection?

Load enhancement charges include:
* Service line charges (if infrastructure upgrade is needed)
* Security deposit for additional load
* Processing fee
A detailed quotation will be shared after the technical assessment.

11. Is a new agreement required if I increase my connected load?
Yes, in most cases, an updated agreement is required if you're increasing your sanctioned load—especially for HT customers or if the tariff category changes. We will guide you through the updated documentation and signing process once your load enhancement request is approved.


12. Can I request a load enhancement online?
Yes, you can easily request a load enhancement through our [ Customer Portal]. Just log in with your account number, go to “Modify Connection”, and select “Enhance Load”. You’ll be prompted to upload necessary documents and schedule a site inspection.

 Load Shifting / Load Reduction – 
16. How do I apply for a reduction in my sanctioned load?
            You can request load reduction by submitting a load revision application through our    customer portal or at your local office. The request is subject to technical feasibility and review.

17. Are there any penalties or charges for reducing the load?
There's typically a nominal processing fee. If you've availed infrastructure upgrades recently, load reduction may not be allowed for a fixed lock-in period.

18. Is load reduction permanent or can I restore it later?
	Load reduction is generally considered permanent, but you can apply for load 		enhancement again in the future if your demand increases.
	Please note:
* 	You may need to submit a fresh load enhancement request with supporting 	documents.
* 	In some cases, there may be a lock-in period after reduction (typically 6–12 	months) during which re-enhancement may not be allowed.

19. Can I shift part of my load to another location or premises under the same name?
	No, shifting part of your sanctioned load to another location or premises is not permitted 	under the same connection.
	Each premises must have its own separate electricity connection and sanctioned load. If 	you’re setting up operations at a new location, you’ll need to:
* Apply for a new connection at that site
* Optionally, request load reduction at your existing location if the requirement has decreased.
Would you like help applying for a new connection or submitting a load reduction request?

20. What’s the minimum limit to which I can reduce my load for HT/LT connections?
	The minimum load requirement varies by category:
* LT Connection: Up to 100 kVA (depending on local regulation).
* HT Connection: Starts from 100 kVA and above.
If you're unsure, our team can assist you in selecting the right category based on your estimated consumption.

21. Will reducing the load affect my billing demand or fixed charges?
	Yes, reducing your sanctioned load will directly impact your billing demand and fixed 	(demand) charges, which are calculated based on the approved load.
* For LT customers, fixed charges per kW will be applied on the revised load.
* For HT customers, demand charges will be based on the sanctioned demand or actual recorded demand, whichever is higher (subject to utility norms).
	Reducing your load can help lower your monthly fixed charges if your actual usage is 	consistently below your current sanctioned load.
	Would you like me to show you a cost comparison or help with a load revision request?

22.  Can I request a temporary electricity connection for a construction site or event?
	Yes, temporary connections are available for construction sites, exhibitions, events, and 	other short-term needs. You’ll need to:
* Submit a temporary connection request
* Provide the duration, load requirement, and purpose
* Upload relevant documents (like event permit or site ownership)
Temporary connections are generally processed within 3 to 7 working days, subject to approval and feasibility.
